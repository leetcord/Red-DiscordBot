# Ooooo! You look so delicious...
# Hi, remember us? We came all the way from the Crystal Empire for some quality family time?
# If you don't mind, has there been any sort of... trouble here, lately?
# Enough!

# Oh, the places we'll go, Spike! Manehattan, Fillydelphia, Canterlot! And there you'll be by my side, just as you've always been here in Ponyville, your constant praise and adoration driving me to even greater heights, until there isn't an inch of Equestria that hasn't been utterly transformed by my creative genius!
